Now, we want to enhance the Big Buddha Statue of Nara, by offering enchanted origamis to the Buddha.

In preparation for this, we need to find out more powerful origami shapes that were not even predicted in the Kojiki. We need help from all of you here; you are all hardworking programmers, so those origami shapes that are insoluble by most of you must hold the strongest power.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We live in a two-dimensional world, so only planar origamis are considered. As long as the origami is a valid two-dimensional mapping, it is allowed to specify </span><span class="c17">impossible</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;folds, that require papers to penetrate each other.

Therefore, the </span><span>high</span><span class="c2">est resemblance attainable by an approximate solution is 0.999999 .</span></p><h2 class="c0 c3" id="h.5hc9pxcjo5e4"><span>S</span><span class="c6">coring</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>Teams are ranked by </span><span class="c4">team score</span><span>. Teams can increase their scores both by submitting problems and solutions. The team score is the sum of the </span><span class="c4">problem score</span><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c4">solution score </span><span class="c2">the team receives, calculated as following.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Submitting a </span><span class="c4">perfect solution,</span><span>&nbsp;that is, a solution with resemblance = 1.0, is important in making high scores. For a problem, let </span><span class="c4">s</span><span>&nbsp;be the size of the problem, and </span><span class="c4">n</span><span>&nbsp;be the number of the teams that submitted a perfect solution, plus 1. The problem-setting team receives (5000 - </span><span class="c4">s</span><span>) / </span><span class="c4">n</span><span>&nbsp;points, and each team that submitted a perfect solution gets </span><span class="c4">s</span><span>&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c4">n</span><span>&nbsp;points. The scores for the teams with imperfect solutions are </span><span>calculated</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>such that</span><span>&nbsp;the total </span><span>points</span><span>&nbsp;earned by all the imperfect solution teams is </span><span class="c4">s</span><span>&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c4">n</span><span class="c2">, and each team’s share is proportional to the resemblance of its solution. Remember, you cannot submit a solution to your own problems.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>For example: when 39 teams submitted a perfect solution to a 1000-bytes problem, the problem-setting team will earn (5000 - 1000) / (39 + 1) = 100.0 points</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>E</span><span class="c2">ach team that submitted a perfect solution will earn 1000 / (39 + 1) = 25.0 points, and each team that submitted an imperfect solution will share the total of 1000 / (39 + 1) = 25.0 points.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you submit multiple solutions to one problem, only the best one is used for scoring.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;That is, the solution with the highest resemblance, and in case of a tie, the solution with the smallest size.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The team with the highest team score is the winner of the contest. In case of a tie, the sum of the sizes of the scoring solutions is calculated for each team. The team with smaller total size will win. </span></p><h2 class="c0 c3" id="h.cg26sptx1t1p"><span class="c6">Rate Limits and Leaderboard Freeze</span></h2><p class="c0"><span>A team may not make more than 1000 submissions per hour (both the problem and the solution submissions count.) </span><span>That is, a</span><span>&nbsp;team can make up to 1000 submission</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;during 00:00 (CC) - 01:00 (CC), 1000 submission</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;during 01:00 (CC) - 02:00 (CC), and so on. Also, </span><span>the </span><span>period between</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>two consecutive submission</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;must be greater than 1 second. The judges will update the problem list and the ranking </span><span>every</span><span>&nbsp;hour, so kindly refrain from refreshing too frequently. The leaderboard will be updated till 66:00 (CC); after that the leaderboard will be frozen</span><span>, and</span><span>&nbsp;the final results will be published at ICFP 2016. The statistics for each problem will be updated till the end of the contest.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c0 c3" id="h.z6l62pfilbc2"><span class="c18">Clarifications and Questions</span></h1><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Please submit your clarifications and questions as comments to this blog article.
